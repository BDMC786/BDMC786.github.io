This is an online simulator for the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." Done as an exercise to practice taking user input and processing it through nested loops to produce an output in JS.

To improve: 

  Allow for misspellings
  
  D3 to append divs to show result (no spaces between submit and reset buttons until results rendered)
